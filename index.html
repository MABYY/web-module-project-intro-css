              <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite,
                  the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.<p>

              <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but
                  within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient
                  giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

                <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how
